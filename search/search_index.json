Speed and ease of implementation is key.</p> <ul> <li>Why Python? Python is very easy to comprehend and has a huge ecosystem. Additionally, IfcOpenShell has a python version and it makes IFC much more accessible. With Jupyter, everthing can be tried before moving the code to a server plaform. And pandas are always welcome to make things simpler.</li> <li>Why FastAPI? Incredibly simple and efficient.</li> <li>Why Celery? Can't do without something to manage heavy tasks and avoid blocking the requester. Celery is a perfect fit, powerful and easy to use.</li> <li>Why Redis? Again, powerful, and easy to use. With Celery, there are multiple options for the Broker and Result Store. Redis caters for the two.</li> <li>Why PostgreSQL? It's mainly why another db? It has all that is needed. It has also Support for Geometry and Graph, via extensions. For extremely large DB, an offloading to HBase with Phoenix could be considered, but that is not needed at this stage.</li> <li>Why SQLModel (on top of SQLAlchemy) to access PostgreSQL? Again ease of use.</li> </ul> <p>When working with IFC, there is always a need for a Viewer. I am using:</p> <ul> <li>OpenIFCViewer</li> <li>ThatOpen (Web)</li> <li>BIMCollab ZOOM</li> <li>Solibri Anywhere</li> <li>Blender with Bonsai; see also the video on Youtube</li> </ul> <p>Why several viewers?: with the difference in versions of the IFC files (2x3, 4.0, ...) and and possible tools rendering issues, I found it a necessity to control results with several viewers. They each have distinctive capabilities.</p> <p>For coding, I use Visual Studio Code and GitHub Copilot. GenAI for coding is a marvel. It does not always provide the solution to the problem but it wonderfully seeds the process that leads to the solution.</p> <p>For the documentation, I use Material for MkDocs.

The filtering approach will obviously need to be fitted to the specific use case at hand. </p> <p>Filtering the content of an IFC is a key element of providing a focused information set that is relevant for a specific administrative use case.</p> <p>A Digital Building Permit will e.g., not need the information for all illustrative furnitures placed in the IfcSpaces. Details on ventilation systems may be relevant or not. Connectedness of walls may be superfluous or not.</p> <p>There are 876 IfcEntities in the spec IFC 4.3.2 Annex B Alphabetical listings - Entities. Which is a lot!</p> <p>There a two ways to filter:</p> <ul> <li>Extraction: select the Elements that we want to keep. This can be done directly on the IFC model with IfcPatch by applying an 'ExtractElements' recipe. This is both efficient and convenient if the list of elements that we want to keep is  limited. Extraction with IfcPatch is illutrated in a separate section (Extract Elements from the IFC model).</li> <li>Filtering out elements that are not needed: this is relatively complex and is the object of this section.</li> </ul> <p>We propose a two-fold approach:</p> <ol> <li>Association of categories (such as 'construction', 'system', ...) to individual entities.  This is defined in the csv under /db/csv/ifc-types-ref.csv. The filter will give the categories that are retained</li> <li>With a given category, some IfcEntities might be superfluous for the use case, so they can be excluded.</li> </ol> <p>The filtering is done by loading the ifcJSON in pandas Dataframes and/or Series, as they provide convenient capabilities.</p> <p>Filtering the elements is not enough. It is critial to ensure that there are no references left to elements that have been filtered out.</p> <p>There are also the relationships that link a relating element (the ''parent'') to a list of related elements (the ''children''). If a ''child'' is removed, it needs to be pruned from the list of related elements. If a ''parent'' loses all its ''children'', it needs to be removed.</p> <p>The relating and related elements are named differently for the many types of relationships.

Public Authorities regulate a larger number of aspects. This includes City Urbanism and Environmental Impact (Energy Performance of Buildings (EPB), Life Cycle Analysis (LCA), Waste, Reuse and Repurpose, City Mining / Building as a Material Bank (BAMB)). Occupation and availability or suitability of Building or Infratucture for their use are also important and require increasingly detailed descriptive technical data. This includes the determination of taxes based on surface or the valuation of property.</p> <p>The Land Administration Domain Model (LADM) ISO 19152-1:2024 brings an interesting perpective on the relationship between Parties, Rights, Restrictions and Responsibilities (RRR), Administrative Units (BAUnit) and Spatial Units (such as buidlings or infrastructure and parts thereof).</p> <pre><code>flowchart LR\n    Party\n    RRR\n    BAUnit\n    SpatialUnit\n    Party --&gt; RRR \n    RRR --&gt; BAUnit\n    BAUnit --&gt; SpatialUnit</code></pre> <p>Many aspects of Public Regulations related to buildings and infrastructure appears as expressions of Rights, Restrictions and Responsibilities (RRR) towards a (Basic) Administration Unit (BAUnit) related to a Spatial Unit.</p> <p>The Cadaster is the primary domain of LADM, but Valuation of property is also included in the scope of LADM and -- in a broader perspective -- the concepts of RRR, BAUnit and Spatial Units are relevant for many administrative regulations.</p> <p>For a given building, there may be numerous BAUnits (and related RRR), each covering a specific aspect:</p> <ul> <li>Urban Permit BAUnit and related Spatial Unit</li> <li>Energy Performance Certificate BAUnit and related Spatial Unit</li> <li>Life Cycle Analysis BAUnit and related Spatial Unit</li> <li>Housing Contract Registration BAUnit and related Spatial Unit</li> <li>Tax on Commercial Surface BAUnit and related Spatial Unit</li> <li>Tax on Office Surface BAUnit and related Spatial Unit</li> <li>Regulated Parking BAUnit and related Spatial Unit</li> <li>...</li> </ul> <p>The issue is that while there is a convergence in the Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Operations (AECO) industry towards the adoption of standard data exchange formats (notably BIM / IFC), there is, in the Public Sector, a lack of adoption of standards to support administrative processes related to Spatial Units. Standards such as BIM/IFC are mostly regarded as too complex and beyond reach.</p> <p>Typically, for each aspect -- i.e., each type of (Basic) Administrative Unit, there will be specfic formats, models and documents requested from the involved Parties to provide Spatial Unit related data.</p> <pre><code>flowchart LR\n    Party\n    RRR\n    BAUnit\n    SpatialUnit\n    Party --&gt; RRR \n    RRR --&gt; BAUnit\n    BAUnit --&gt; SpatialUnit\n    Data[\"BAUnit specific Data &amp; Documents related to the corresponding Spatial Unit\"] --&gt; BAUnit</code></pre> <p>This means concretely that there will be specific data collection, data processing, data exchanges, documents format and Case Management processes for each type of BAUnit</p> <ul> <li>Urban Permit BAUnit : specific forms, plans, documents, proof of rights, ...</li> <li>Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) BAUnit : specific forms, geometry, material, quantities, ... for energy consumption modeling</li> <li>Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) BAUnit : lots of data common to EPC but mostly a separate data collection and processing</li> <li>Housing Contract BAUnit : number of rooms, type and surface thereof, HVAC, ...</li> <li>Commercial Surface BAUnit : surface subject to a non residential tax,</li> <li>Office Surface BAUnit : type of usage, surface subject to a non residential tax,</li> <li>Regulated Parking BAUnit : type and number of places, electric charging stations, ...</li> <li>...</li> </ul> <p>This is not always the case and some countries and localities have already adopted a more streamlined approach which often relies on BIM.</p> <p>However, generally speaking, adoption of standards is infrequent or incomplete and the number of distinct data formats, streams and disparate semantics becomes increasingly problematic.
